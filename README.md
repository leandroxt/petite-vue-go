# Warning 

This is just an example of how to capture the output of a shell execution and show on the page the result.
Passing to a shell script inputs from the user page is extremely dangerous and you should **NOT** do that. 
You would be granting permission to someone to destroy your server, run whatever they want, and more.
This app is just for training purposes.

## Run the program

`$ make run`

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
